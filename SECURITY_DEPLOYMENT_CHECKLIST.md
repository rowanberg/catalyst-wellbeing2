# üîí Catalyst Wells Security Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Security Verification

Use this checklist before deploying to production to ensure all security measures are properly configured.

---

## ‚úÖ Environment Configuration

- [ ] **Create `.env.local`** from `.env.example` template
- [ ] **Set all required environment variables** with real values
- [ ] **Generate strong `SUPER_ADMIN_SECRET_KEY`** (minimum 32 characters)
  ```bash
  # Generate using OpenSSL:
  openssl rand -hex 32
  ```
- [ ] **Verify Supabase credentials** are production values
- [ ] **Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=production`** for production
- [ ] **Configure `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`** with actual domain

---

## ‚úÖ Database Security

- [ ] **Run security indexes migration** in Supabase:
  ```sql
  -- Execute: database/security_performance_indexes.sql
  ```
- [ ] **Verify RLS policies** are enabled on all tables:
  ```sql
  SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
  FROM pg_tables 
  WHERE schemaname = 'public';
  ```
- [ ] **Create audit_logs table** if not exists
- [ ] **Test database connections** with limited permissions
- [ ] **Backup database** before deployment

---

## ‚úÖ Code Security Verification

- [ ] **No hardcoded credentials** in codebase:
  ```bash
  # Search for potential issues:
  grep -r "SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY\!" src/
  grep -r "process.env\." src/ | grep -v "NEXT_PUBLIC"
  ```
- [ ] **No console.log of sensitive data**:
  ```bash
  grep -r "console.log.*user" src/
  grep -r "console.log.*password" src/
  grep -r "console.log.*token" src/
  ```
- [ ] **All API routes use authentication**:
  ```bash
  # Check for unprotected routes:
  grep -l "export.*function.*GET\|POST\|PUT\|DELETE" src/app/api/**/*.ts | xargs grep -L "auth\|Auth"
  ```

---

## ‚úÖ Dependencies & Packages

- [ ] **Install production dependencies**:
  ```bash
  npm ci --production
  ```

  ```bash
  npm audit
  npm audit fix # If any found
  ```
- [ ] **Update all packages** to latest stable versions

---

## ‚úÖ Build & Deployment

  ```
- [ ] **Rate limiting** is active

---

## ‚úÖ Authentication & Authorization
