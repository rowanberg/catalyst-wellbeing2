# ✅ Email Field Fix - Complete Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-26  
**Issue:** Profiles table has email column but it wasn't being populated during registration

---

## 🔧 FILES UPDATED

### 1. **`/api/create-profile/route.ts`** ✅
**Roles:** Student, Parent, Teacher, Admin (General registration endpoint)

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added email existence check before creating auth user
- ✅ Added `email` field to profile data (Line 83)
- ✅ Added rollback: Deletes auth user if profile creation fails

```typescript
const profileData: any = {
  user_id: user.id,
  email: email || '', // ✅ NOW STORED
  first_name: firstName,
  last_name: lastName,
  role,
  school_id: school.id,
  // ...
}
```

---

### 2. **`/api/register-student/route.ts`** ✅
**Roles:** Student only (Student-specific registration)

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `email` field to profile creation (Line 81)

```typescript
.insert({
  user_id: authData.user.id,
  email: validatedData.email, // ✅ NOW STORED
  first_name: validatedData.firstName,
  last_name: validatedData.lastName,
  role: 'student',
  // ...
})
```

---

### 3. **`/api/create-admin-profile/route.ts`** ✅
**Roles:** Admin only

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `email` to profile INSERT (Line 111)
- ✅ Added `email` to profile UPDATE (Line 84)

```typescript
// Create
.insert({
  user_id: user.id,
  email: user.email, // ✅ NOW STORED
  first_name: firstName,
  // ...
})

// Update
.update({
  email: user.email, // ✅ NOW UPDATED
  first_name: firstName,
  // ...
})
```

---

### 4. **`/api/verify-student/route.ts`** ✅
**Already queries by email** - Will work once existing data is backfilled

```typescript
// Line 54-56
.select('id, user_id, email, first_name, last_name, role')
.eq('email', email)  // ✅ Queries email field
.eq('id', studentId)
```

---

### 5. **`/api/fix-orphaned-student/route.ts`** ✅
**Cleanup utility** - Fixes students with auth but no profile

---

## 📊 COVERAGE BY ROLE

| Role | Endpoint | Email Stored? |
|------|----------|---------------|
| Student | `/api/create-profile` | ✅ YES |
| Student | `/api/register-student` | ✅ YES |
| Parent | `/api/create-profile` | ✅ YES |
| Teacher | `/api/create-profile` | ✅ YES |
| Admin | `/api/create-admin-profile` | ✅ YES |
| Admin | `/api/create-profile` | ✅ YES |

**Result:** ALL roles now store email in profiles table ✅

---

## 🗄️ DATABASE MIGRATION

**File:** `database/migrations/add_email_to_profiles.sql`

**Purpose:** Backfill email for existing profiles

```sql
-- Backfill existing profiles with email from auth.users
UPDATE profiles p
SET email = au.email
FROM auth.users au
WHERE p.user_id = au.id
  AND (p.email IS NULL OR p.email = '');
```

**Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS TO BE RUN IN SUPABASE

---

## ✅ WHAT'S FIXED

1. ✅ All new registrations store email in profiles
2. ✅ Email lookups now work for verify-student
3. ✅ Parent registration can verify students by email
4. ✅ No more orphaned auth users (rollback added)
5. ✅ Email existence check prevents duplicates
6. ✅ Admin profiles also store email

---

## ⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED

### **Run This SQL in Supabase:**

```sql
-- Backfill existing profiles
UPDATE profiles p
SET email = au.email
FROM auth.users au
WHERE p.user_id = au.id
  AND (p.email IS NULL OR p.email = '');

-- Verify
SELECT 
  role,
  COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT(email) as with_email
FROM profiles
GROUP BY role;
```

### **After Migration:**

1. ✅ Test student registration → Email should appear in profiles table
2. ✅ Test parent registration → Should verify students successfully
3. ✅ Test teacher registration → Email stored
4. ✅ Test admin creation → Email stored

---

## 📝 NOTES

- `create-profile` is the main endpoint used by the `/register` page
- `register-student` is a separate student-specific endpoint
- Both now store email correctly
- Old profiles need SQL backfill (run once)
- New profiles automatically get email field

---

## 🎯 PARENT REGISTRATION FIX

**Before:**
```
Parent tries to verify student
↓
API queries: SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE email = 'student@email.com'
↓
❌ Email field is NULL → Not found
```

**After:**
```
Parent tries to verify student
↓
API queries: SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE email = 'student@email.com'
↓
✅ Email field populated → Student found!
```

---

**All registration endpoints now store email for all roles!** ✅
