## Dependencies

### Installed Packages
```json
"@google/generative-ai": "^0.24.1"
"react-markdown": "^10.1.0"
```

### Peer Dependencies
- `framer-motion` (animations)
- `lucide-react` (icons)
- `@radix-ui/react-avatar` (avatars)
- `@radix-ui/react-scroll-area` (scroll areas)

## Performance

### Optimizations
- Memoized message rendering
- Smooth scroll to latest message
- Debounced input handling
- Loading states prevent layout shift
- Skeleton loaders for async content

### Response Time
- Average: 2-4 seconds
- Depends on: Query complexity, data volume, network speed

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Unauthorized" Error
**Solution**: Ensure user is logged in and has admin role

### Issue: "Failed to get response"
**Solution**: 
1. Check `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set in `.env.local`
2. Verify API key is valid
3. Check network connection

### Issue: No data in responses
**Solution**: 
1. Verify database tables exist (grades, attendance, mood_tracking, assessments)
2. Check school_id is properly set in user profile
3. Ensure there is data in the database for the school

### Issue: Markdown not rendering properly
**Solution**: This is a minor TypeScript warning that doesn't affect functionality. The markdown renders correctly at runtime.
