- ✅ Added debug logging for data flow tracking

## 📋 How Student Registration Works Now

### Registration Flow:
```
Student fills form → Selects Grade → Selects Class (UUID)
                          ↓
                  Submits Registration
                          ↓
            POST /api/create-profile
                          ↓
        Creates user + profile in database
                          ↓
      Verifies class exists and belongs to school
                          ↓
     Creates student_class_assignments record:
     {
       student_id: user.id,
       class_id: selected_class_uuid,
       school_id: school.id,
       is_active: true,
       assigned_at: NOW()
     }
                          ↓
      Updates class.current_students count
                          ↓
           ✅ Registration Complete
```

### Console Logs During Registration:
```
📝 Creating class assignment for student John Doe: { student_id, class_id, school_id, class_name }
✅ Successfully assigned student John Doe to class "2nd ultimates"
📊 Updated class "2nd ultimates" student count to 5
```

## 🎯 How Teacher Views Students

### Viewing Flow:
```
Teacher visits /teacher/students/
            ↓
    Views grades list
            ↓
    Clicks on "Grade 2"
            ↓
API: GET /api/teacher/classes?school_id=XXX&grade_level_id=YYY&teacher_id=ZZZ
            ↓
    Shows classes for Grade 2
            ↓
    Clicks on "2nd ultimates"
            ↓
API: GET /api/teacher/students?school_id=XXX&class_id=YYY
            ↓
    Query: student_class_assignments WHERE class_id = YYY AND is_active = true
            ↓
    Fetches student profiles
            ↓
    Displays student list
```

### Console Logs When Viewing Students:
```
🎓 Grade selected: [grade-uuid]
📚 Fetching classes for grade: [grade-uuid]
✅ Classes fetched: 3 classes
🎯 Class selected: [class-uuid]
🚀 loadStudentsForClass called with: { classId, userId, hasUser: true }
🏫 Initial school_id from user: [school-uuid]
📡 Making API call with: { schoolId, classId }
✅ Students loaded successfully: 5
👥 Students data changed: { count: 5, selectedClass, studentsLoading: false }
```

## 🔧 Database Schema

### student_class_assignments Table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE student_class_assignments (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    student_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    class_id UUID REFERENCES classes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    school_id UUID REFERENCES schools(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    assigned_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    UNIQUE(student_id, class_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_student_class_assignments_student_id ON student_class_assignments(student_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_student_class_assignments_class_id ON student_class_assignments(class_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_student_class_assignments_school_id ON student_class_assignments(school_id);
```

## ✅ Testing Checklist

### Test New Student Registration:
1. Go to registration page
2. Fill in student details
3. Select grade level
4. Select a class
5. Submit registration
6. Check console logs for: ✅ Successfully assigned student...
7. Check Supabase: Query `student_class_assignments` table
8. Verify: New record exists with correct `student_id`, `class_id`, `is_active = true`

### Test Teacher Viewing Students:
1. Login as teacher
2. Go to `/teacher/students/`
3. Click on a grade level
4. Verify: Classes appear for that grade
5. Click on a class
6. Verify: Students appear in the list
7. Check console logs for: ✅ Students loaded successfully: X

### Test Manual Assignment (if needed):
```sql
-- Assign all Grade 2 students to "2nd ultimates" class
INSERT INTO student_class_assignments (student_id, class_id, school_id, is_active, assigned_at)
SELECT 
  p.user_id,
  '1aed301a-7e74-4c8c-a142-0d094bbf9712'::uuid,
  p.school_id,
  true,
  NOW()
FROM profiles p
WHERE p.school_id = 'f2baa26b-ad79-4576-bead-e57dc942e4f8'
  AND p.role = 'student'
  AND p.grade_level = '2'
ON CONFLICT (student_id, class_id) DO NOTHING;
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Students not showing after registration:
1. Check server console logs during registration
2. Look for error messages in class assignment section
3. Query: `SELECT * FROM student_class_assignments WHERE student_id = 'XXX'`
4. Verify `is_active = true`

### Students not showing in teacher view:
1. Check browser console logs when clicking class
2. Look for API call logs: `📡 Making API call with: { schoolId, classId }`
3. Verify both IDs are not null
4. Check server logs: `🔍 Students API called with: { schoolId, classId }`
5. Query database to verify assignments exist

### Class student count not updating:
1. Check if trigger exists: `trigger_update_class_student_count`
2. Manually update counts:
```sql
UPDATE classes c
SET current_students = (
  SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM student_class_assignments sca
  WHERE sca.class_id = c.id AND sca.is_active = true
)
WHERE c.school_id = 'YOUR_SCHOOL_ID';
```

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Test the registration flow** with a new student
2. **Verify automatic assignment** works
3. **Test teacher view** shows students correctly
4. **Monitor console logs** for any errors

## 🎉 Summary

- ✅ Automatic assignment during registration
- ✅ Proper validation and error handling  
- ✅ Real-time student count updates
- ✅ Teacher view with grade → class → students navigation
